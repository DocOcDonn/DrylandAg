Although it would be best if you used the <a href="https://github.com/akkagawa/DrylandAg/tree/master/Scripts"> scripts provided </a> to calculate seasonality statistics on your own, we have provided calculated statistics used for this analysis (as geotiffs).  Feel free to download and use the data and code in this repo for non-commerical purposes. If you publish analyses using our data or code, be sure to cite the paper above. Thank you!
